# Heart-Failure-Prediction

This repository provides a comprehensive analysis and implementation of machine learning models for predicting heart failure events. Using Jupyter Notebooks, the project explores data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and interpretation on heart failure clinical records.

## Overview

Cardiovascular diseases are one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early prediction of heart failure can help in taking preventive measures. This project leverages various machine learning techniques to predict heart failure events, providing insights into which features are most influential in the prediction process.

## Dataset

The dataset used is typically the [Heart Failure Clinical Records Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Failure+Clinical+Records), containing medical records of patients with features such as age, sex, ejection fraction, serum creatinine, and more.

## Features

- Data loading and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, scaling, encoding)
- Feature selection and engineering
- Model building (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, etc.)
- Model evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix, ROC-AUC)
- Visualization of results and feature importance
- Model interpretability

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AliHadi-RAI/Heart-Failure-Prediction.git
   cd Heart-Failure-Prediction
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**  
   It is recommended to use a virtual environment.
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   Or install manually (see [Requirements](#requirements)).

## Usage

1. **Open Jupyter Notebook:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. **Run the notebook(s):**  
   Follow the cells step by step to reproduce the analysis and results.
